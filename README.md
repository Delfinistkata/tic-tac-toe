# **TIC-TAC-TOE** 

<br>

<p> Welcome to Tic-tac-toe, also known as Naughts and Crosses, is one of the most widely known games. 
    Found everywhere from the temples of ancient Egypt to the medieval cathedrals of England, tic-tac-toe has entertained people for centuries. 
    While tic-tac-toe is now considered to be a child's game, it was not always the case. 
    In the past, the game was linked to pagan rituals dedicated to the magic properties of the nine-square grid. 
    The grid was known as the Magic Square because the numbers 1-9 could be arranged so that their sum is the same horizontally, diagonally or vertically.

<br>

# Design Choices

<br>

 ## Typography
 <p> The font chosen was 'Tanjawan' for the heading and for the body text. They fall back to sans-serif respectively. </p>

  * 'Tanjawan' was chosen for the headings to give the user an inital welcoming feel and for the body text as it goes along nicely with the heading whilst being easy to read for all.

<br>

 ## Colour Scheme

  <p> The colour scheme eventually chosen is one based on black, whitesmoke, red.
      The black colour contrasts with the images on the home page and the game page and it is an easy color to read. Red colour was used to catch the user's eye and to draw their attention to the heading of the game.
