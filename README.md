# Site Structure

<br>

<p> The game has three pages. The home page is the default loading page, rules and game pages are all accessible primarily from the buttons on the default loading page. </p>

**[Back to top](<#contents>)**

<br>
<br>

# Design Choices

<br>

 ## Typography
 <p> The font chosen was 'Tanjawan' for the heading and for the body text. They fall back to sans-serif respectively. </p>

  * 'Tanjawan' was chosen for the headings to give the user an inital welcoming feel and for the body text as it goes along nicely with the heading whilst being easy to read for all.

<br>

 ## Colour Scheme

  <p> The colour scheme eventually chosen is one based on black, whitesmoke, red.
      The black colour contrasts with the images on the home page and the rules page and it is an easy color to read. Red colour was used to catch the user's eye and to draw their attention to the heading of the game.
